          | How we do it in the speaker program:
          | 4 step list
          | 1/ Write ideas on paper. Lots of them. Just dump. Don't apply judgment on it.
          | 2/ Suggest ideas to other people (group of 4-5 works well). listen to feedback, what do they like
          | 3/ Sort ideas in your favorite order (not audience order)
          | 4/ Start working on the idea on top
        
        // WHERE SHOULD I TALK?
        section

          | People you already know. Subject you're all familiar with.

          | - Post Mortem of last issue
          | - New language/tool you've tried as a side project
          | - What the hell, talk about something else you're passionate about that has nothing to do with work
        section
          | Meetups
          | Paris. Many meetups (screenshot of techs meetups on meetup.com?)
          | Meetup accept talks easily. Can even play it in several meetups (js, react, pwa, etc)
        section
          | Conferences. A bit more involvment.
          | CFP
          | - Title: Think multi tracks. Catchy. People will choose based on that in the heat of action
          | - Abstract: Tell more about the content. Social contract, don't break it.
          | - Private info: Talk to the organizes. Explain the content, your goals, why this talk is interesting, etc.
          | - Slides/Video: Will help the organize pick you. Would rather take more experencent speakers
        section
          | How we do it:
          | Make it collaborative. Google Doc where speaker adds their ideas. 3-4 different titles. Iterative improving of abstract,
          | proof-reading, etc. Shared and can be re-used.

        // WHEN. ABOUT TIMING
        section
          | How long should my talk be?
          | TEDTalks, scientifically proven 18mn attention span. Find that pretty accurate.
          | 25mn still ok. 30mn max. 10mn interesting. Short and concise.
          | If more. Make a "break" in the middle. Tell a story, let their mind rest
        section
          | Should I go first? Last?
          | - First, need to wake them up.
          | - Last, might be tired of the day
          | - Right before lunch, they will be hungry
          | - Right after lunch, they will be sleepy
          | No better time for the audience. Find what is best for you. I prefer going first, so I have time to discuss with people.

        // HOW CAN I PREPARE MY SLIDES
        section
          | Lived with a writer. When had to prepare a story, here is how he did it:
          | - write everything that seems interesting. Idea, code example, great sentence, great picture.
          | - sort them by "room". Here it's the bathroom, the bedroom, etc
          | - order rooms between eahc other, to have a logical path
          | - sort each room, ordering what is great and not so great
          | Turns out my roomate later wrote "Bref", so sound advice

          | - Make them tweetable (@handle + simple message)

          | We do rehearsal (at least 2) before talk
