Pictures of Algolians on stage?
Helping people share what they're expert and pasisonate about.
Support them and help them in the rest so they can focus on what they do best</section><section> List of questions
Most common blockers:
I have nothing to say
I'm afraid of going on stage
I don't know any meetup or conference
I don't know how to prepare slides</section><!-- WHY SHOULD I SPEAK?--><section>Why?
"I'm a developer. I don't talk to people"</section><section> list of 3 points
Share what you know
Great for career advancement, you're an expert
Makes you go deeper. Next step of learning is teaching</section><section>Define the various 6 steps. 6 spots, appearing one by one. With picture of knows speakers/events
- I talk about what I do around coffee
- I do internal presentations at the end of projects
- I present stuff in meetups
- I talk in paid conferences
- I fly abroad to talk in several conferences
- I'm invited to talk at events
Where are you. Where would you like to go?</section><!-- WHAT CAN I TALK ABOUT?--><section>"You have things to say". Full page
Most important advice ever</section><section> Imposter syndrom image
Imposter Syndrome. What you know, what they know.
Kill the little voice in your head telling you not to do it
What would you have love to hear when you started this job?</section><section>Gartner curve, explaining what to talk about in each part</section><section>You can't be wrong when sharing experiences</section><section> How we do it in the speaker program:
4 step list
1/ Write ideas on paper. Lots of them. Just dump. Don't apply judgment on it.
2/ Suggest ideas to other people (group of 4-5 works well). listen to feedback, what do they like
3/ Sort ideas in your favorite order (not audience order)
4/ Start working on the idea on top</section><!-- WHERE SHOULD I TALK?--><section>Internal. 
People you already know. Subject you're all familiar with.
- Retro of last project
- Post Mortem of last issue
- New language/tool you've tried as a side project
- What the hell, talk about something else you're passionate about that has nothing to do with work</section><section>Meetups
Paris. Many meetups (screenshot of techs meetups on meetup.com?)
Meetup accept talks easily. Can even play it in several meetups (js, react, pwa, etc)</section><section>Conferences. A bit more involvment.
CFP
- Title: Think multi tracks. Catchy. People will choose based on that in the heat of action
- Abstract: Tell more about the content. Social contract, don't break it.
- Private info: Talk to the organizes. Explain the content, your goals, why this talk is interesting, etc.
- Slides/Video: Will help the organize pick you. Would rather take more experencent speakers</section><section>How we do it:
Make it collaborative. Google Doc where speaker adds their ideas. 3-4 different titles. Iterative improving of abstract,
proof-reading, etc. Shared and can be re-used.</section><!-- WHEN. ABOUT TIMING--><section>How long should my talk be?
TEDTalks, scientifically proven 18mn attention span. Find that pretty accurate.
25mn still ok. 30mn max. 10mn interesting. Short and concise.
If more. Make a "break" in the middle. Tell a story, let their mind rest</section><section>Should I go first? Last?
- First, need to wake them up.
- Last, might be tired of the day
- Right before lunch, they will be hungry
- Right after lunch, they will be sleepy
No better time for the audience. Find what is best for you. I prefer going first, so I have time to discuss with people.</section><!-- HOW CAN I PREPARE MY SLIDES--><section>Lived with a writer. When had to prepare a story, here is how he did it:
- write everything that seems interesting. Idea, code example, great sentence, great picture.
- sort them by "room". Here it's the bathroom, the bedroom, etc
- order rooms between eahc other, to have a logical path
- sort each room, ordering what is great and not so great
Turns out my roomate later wrote "Bref", so sound advice</section><section>Tooling is important. Use the best tool for you.
Keynote if on mac, PowerPoint windows, Google Slides.
List of logos of each
Personal story: Hated PowerPoint, moved to Reveal.js</section><section>Tips for slides
- Introduce yourself. Why are you the best to talk about that. Say your name aloud.
- Make your slides understandable without sound
- Make them tweetable (@handle + simple message)
- Avoid gimmicks
- Add a time indicator</section><section>Takes time.
- 1mn of talk = 1 hour of prep = 1.5 slides
Included finding idea, writing it down, creating slides, re-reading, rehearsal
We do rehearsal (at least 2) before talk</section><!-- I'M AFRAID OF BEING ON STAGE--><section>I'm scared to go on stage.
That's normal. Not natural to be watched by many people at once.
Danger situation. Adrenaline rush. Need to use it correctly.</section><section>Stress is inside of you. Bifidus actif is wrong. Does not show outside.
HTTP 418: I'm a teapot. Can be storm inside, can't be seen outside</section><section>Easy to say...
Well. Record and watch. Hard, but most important part</section><section>Enjoy the moment. Enjoy the adrenaline, it's like skydiving
A few ways to lower your stress, so you can enjoy it more
- People are coming for your content, not you
- It's not theatre. You're not here to be loved. You're here to have a message.
- Rehearsal will help you feel better. Go to the room before
- Prepare intro and conclusion</section><!-- HAVING AN IMPACT--><section>Non-verbal
- Add silences
- Stay firm on your feet
- Don't touch your hands. Speak with them.
- No "I hope", "I'm sorry"</section><section>Tell a story. Tips from being a game master.
- Maybe tell a story (monomyth. Start, opposition, refusal, new world, challenges, treasure, back to initial boss)
- Repeat things 3 times. What should they remember? Say it three times</section><section>At Aloglia. Public speaking classes (2 days) with teacher for every employee
People loves it. Helps in everyday talk.
If start doing talks 1 month after, keep doing them because they enjoy it</section><!-- AFTER THE SHOW--><section>Post slides on Twitter/Meetup.com
Share the video (and watch it!)
Play it several times, capitalize on the time invested</section><!-- QUESTIONS--><section> How to handle question.
After the show, not during.</section><section>Duo presenting?
Perceval and Karadoc. Only good if opposition.</section><!-- include ./slides/getting-data--><!-- include ./slides/tips--><!-- include ./slides/ui--><!-- Contact--><section class="slide--horizontal slide--theme1"><div class="bg-gradient-primary white h-100 flcnw flc"><div class="f-headline"><div class="di c-contact c-contact--email" data-name="email">tim@<div class="di c-contact c-contact--website" data-name="website"><div class="di c-contact c-contact--twitter" data-name="twitter">pixelastic</div>.com</div></div></div></div></section><div class="aside--horizontal absolute right-0 bottom-0 left-0 z-5 flrnw"><a class="fln bg-deep-cove pv3 ph4" href="https://www.algolia.com/"><img class="w4" src="./ui/algolia-logo-dark-bg.svg"></a><div class="fla bg-gradient-primary bg-white--theme1 flrnw tr pr4 f6 white bunting--theme1"><div class="fla flcnw flccv"><div class="fw4">Algolia Speaker Program</div><div class="fw3"><div class="di">Tim Carry</div><a class="fw3 no-underline bunting ml2" href="https://twitter.com/Tim Carry">@pixelastic</a></div></div></div></div><div class="aside--vertical absolute top-0 bottom-0 left-0 z-5 flcnw"><a class="fln flccv bg-deep-cove pa3" href="https://www.algolia.com/"><img class="h2" src="./ui/algolia-logo-dark-bg.svg"></a><div class="fla bg-gradient-primary flcnw f6 white ph2 pv3"><div class="fw4 mta">Algolia Speaker Program</div><div class="fw3">Tim Carry</div><a class="fw3 white no-underline" href="https://twitter.com/Tim Carry">@pixelastic</a></div></div></div></div><script src="./js/vendors/head.js"></script><script src="./js/vendors/reveal.js"></script><script src="./js/vendors/lodash.js"></script><script src="./js/vendors/jquery.js"></script><script src="./vendor.js"></script><script src="./app.js"></script><script>require('javascripts/app').default.init()</script></body></html>
